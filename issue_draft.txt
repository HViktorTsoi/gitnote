Hi, it's because the system did not initialize from the begining. During initialization, the initial pose (including position and attitude angle) should be near the real-world pose. Did you test localization with the same data that you built the map with, so you assume that **0 0 0 0 0 0** is your initial pose? Please make sure **0 0 0 0 0 0** or the pose estimation from RVIZ is close to your real-world pose.

And it may not be the issue with the LiDAR-IMU extrinsic, if your sensor setup is tested successfully in fastlio, the it's also compatible with fastlio localization. 

It will be more efficient if you may provide the test bag and the sample map for debugging, to cuijiahetony@live.com, or at leaset post some visualization from RVIZ, of the the pointcloud for initailization and the map.
